Memory pool allocator that help to improve memory allocation speed and
memory usage by improving memory locality during data manipulation. To
do so it require a little bit more help from the developper to tell
him what kind of usage pattern the allocator must expect.

It also include a static buffer allocator, thus avoiding any further
syscall, but in that case the maximum available memory will only be
64MBytes.

To help the developper in optimizing and providing this information,
it provide some pretty good statistic so that developers can learn a
bit more how the application consume and use in real world the
allocated data.

It also include, in debug mode, a lot of assertion and memory
verification which stop as soon as detected the program. This will
also help the developper by reducing the time between a memory
corruption and it's detection.
