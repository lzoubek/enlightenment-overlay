Exposes Ecore library as Python module.

Ecore handles Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) main loop and
basic Input/Output systems such as X11, DirectFB, FrameBuffer as well
as functionality around it, with Networking (libcurl) and so on. The
python bindings are not as extensive, but covers the basic usage for
most applications.

Optionally provides access to Evas through ecore.evas module, if
"evas" flag is used.

Optionally provides access to X11 through ecore.x module, if
"X" flag is used.

Optionally provides access to X ScreenSaver extension through
ecore.x.screensaver module, if "xscreensaver" flag is used.
