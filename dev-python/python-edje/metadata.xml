Exposes EFL/Edje library as Python module.

Edje is a powerful theme system for applications using Evas as their
drawing canvas. Unlike most engines, it is not just about image
replacement, but completely abstracting view from code by contracts
establishing signals and part names.

See media-libs/edje.
