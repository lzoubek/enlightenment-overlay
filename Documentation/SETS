Dynamic sets:

@enlightenment-rebuild	= rebuilds all installed packages from this overlay.
				nice for rebuilding, as it will rebuild also
				enlightenment-specific dependencies (simple
				rerun of emerge on some static set will not)

@enlightenment-all	= all ebuilds from overlay, excluding those listed
				into @enlightenment-broken (see below). Still
				broken ebuild might be fetched as
				dependencies. Use it, if you want to install
				and try all known packages of enlightenment.

Static sets:
	Meta sets:

		@enlightenment = @enlightenment-modules + @enlightenment-wm
		@enlightenment-extended = @enlightenment + @enlightenment-misc
				+ @enlightenment-themes

@enlightenment-wm	= Pure wm install with deps, no modules, no others.
@enlightenment-modules	= All e-modules and all known to developers
						third-party working modules.
@enlightenment-misc	= Additional programs considered to be especially
						useful.
@enlightenment-themes	=	Additional themes for E17 and elementary
@enlightenment-proto	= Programs considered to be prototypes or some testing
				ground. Sometimes it will just not compile,
				but sometimes it may contains something
				geniuos and awesome.

Developer sets:

@enlightenment-old	= Programs that are not updated for a long time. Most
				probably would fail to compile. Keeped for
				archiving and for testing if some old program
				suddenly will became new =)

@enlightenment-broken	= List of programs known to be broken for a long time
				Used by @enlightenment-all script for
				excluding and filtering them out
